#In this project, we worked with 2 tables ("netflix_titles_info" and "netflix_people"). In the 2 tables, we had the following columns for each table:

"netflix_titles_info"
  - show_id
  - type
  - title
  - country
  - date_added
  - release_year
  - rating
  - duration
  - listed_in
  - description
  
"netflix_people"
  - show_id
  - director
  - cast
  
#We used PostreSQL to pull various data from our 2 tables. 
#I starting by joining the two tables (”netflix_people” and “netflix_titles_info”) using a LEFT JOIN, joining the tables with the key “show_id”. 
I wanted to display the following columns:
director
show_id
title
type

In my findings, I was able to answer the following 5 questions.

1. How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not tv shows)

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';

--Answer=6131

2. When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added)) FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";

--Answer = 2021-09-25

3. List all the movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title;

4. Who was the Director for the movie Bright Star?

SELECT director, title FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people"
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ON "netflix_people"."show_id"="netflix_titles_info"."show_id"
WHERE "netflix_titles_info"."title"='Bright Star';

5. What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
ORDER BY release_year
LIMIT 1;
